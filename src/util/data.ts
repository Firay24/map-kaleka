  "At the heart of Kaleka’s approach, is the concept of Collaborative, Action Research. Before commencing any work, we work with our partners, including the government at the national and sub-national levels, civil society organizations, producer, manufacturing and consumer-facing companies, universities, farmers and local communities, to identify their priorities. Through researching best practices in science, while incorporating local and indigenous knowledge, we test, implement, evaluate and refine innovations. This approach ensures the acceptability and relevance of interventions to local partners while also allowing us to scale nationally.",
